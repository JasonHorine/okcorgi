# okcorgi-

##Background: 
####This project was created by a classmate and me in a few hours on a Friday 'lab day' on April 1, 2016.  Being April 1, there were quite a few distractions that day.

####Check the commits after April 1 to find work I did alone outside of class.

##Overview:
####The site is built on Node.js with Express.  It uses Mongoose to connect to an mLab database server.  The server stores information about Corgis.
